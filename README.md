# LoLstattracker

2024: With the recent changes to the user API, this is currently deprecated. 

A Flask-based tool that uses the Riot Developer API to display the given user's change in winrate across 40 games (by default), as well as a few other default stats. The project is built so that a query for match count can be added easily, and other stats from the Riot API can be tracked and compared. 

TODO:

Add HTML template for neater formatting
